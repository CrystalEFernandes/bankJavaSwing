# Abstract
In order to create and 
develop an ATM system, the project is broken down into four diverse phases to lead 
it in the best direction possible. 

The components are: 

• Authentication process performed through PINs (This system should provide 
secure authenticated connections between users and the bank servers) 

• Account selection 

• Banking services/Transactions- quick cash withdrawal, balance check, 
transfer and deposit cash 

• Other unique services-24x7 customer service and FAQS page. 

# Features
The various functions included in dashboard are as follows: 

1. DEPOSIT: In deposit, the user enters the amount to be deposited and once 
the transaction is successful a message is displayed on a dialogue box 
conveying the same.

2. TRANSFER: In transfer, the user enters the account number of the account 
where user wants to transfer the money as well as the amount to be 
transferred. A dialogue box is displayed once successful.

3. WITHDRAWAL: In withdraw, the user enters the amount to be withdrawn. 
If the money to be withdrawn exceeds the balance, then you get a message 
stating the balance is insufficient.

4. BALANCE: This feature gives user the exact balance in your bank account 
after any transaction
